# Parallel Coordinate Gradient descent implementation
## IPSC PROJECT

### We are going to use algorithm-PCDM1 and implement these two problems as given in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10107-015-0901-6.pdf) 
1. A LASSO problem with 1 billion variables (Section 8.1 & Section 8.2)  
2. Training linear SVMs with bad data for PCDM (Section 8.3)


### Tasks to do - 
*   Run the lasso problem on CPU(done)
*   Run the lasso problem on GPU with CUDA(next)
*   Run the SVM problem on CPU 
*   Run the SVM problem on GPU with CUDA
*   Compare CPU and GPU results for both
